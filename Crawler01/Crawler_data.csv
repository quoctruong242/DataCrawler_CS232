Recommend-Me: recommending query regions for image search,"['Thanh Duc Ngo', 'Sang Phan', 'Duy-Dinh Le', ""Shin'ichi Satoh""]",March 2014  ,SAC '14: Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,"In typical image retrieval systems, to search for an object, users must specify a region bounding the object in an input image. There are situations that the queried region does not have any match with regions in images of the retrieved database. Finding a region in the input image to form a good query, which certainly returns relevant results, is a tedious task because users need to try all possible query regions without prior knowledge about what objects are really existed in the database. This paper presents a novel recommendation system, named Recommend-Me, which automatically recommends good query regions to users."
News Archive Exploration Combining Face Detection and Tracking with Network Visual Analytics,"['Benjamin Renoust', 'Thanh Duc Ngo', 'Duy-Dinh Le', ""Shin'Ichi Satoh""]",October 2016  ,MM '16: Proceedings of the 24th ACM international conference on Multimedia,"Visual analytics helps analytical reasoning and exploration of complex systems, for which it combines the means of interactive visualization, with the power of data analytics. The recent progress in computer vision techniques opens wide applications in real world video archives. Particularly, recent advances in face detection and recognition have been put under the spotlight. The applications of such techniques are often concern intelligence, or peer recognition in photo posted in social networks. We propose to combine those two domains by demonstrating a visual exploration of over a decade of the news program from the Japanese broadcaster NHK News 7. We derive social networks from face detection and tracking of this large dataset. With the help of a little domain knowledge, we monitor the activity of political public figures and explore the archive. This allows understanding and comparison of the politico-media scene presented by NHK under different Prime Minister's governance. The social networks are interactive, and also allow to explore the multimedia database and explore its video content."
Searching a specific person in a specific location using deep features,"['Vinh-Tiep Nguyen', 'Minh-Triet Tran', 'Thanh Duc Ngo', 'Duy-Dinh Le', 'Duc Anh Duong']",December 2016  ,SoICT '16: Proceedings of the Seventh Symposium on Information and Communication Technology,"Video instance search or also well known as object retrieval is a fundamental task in computer vision field and has a lot of applications. Most state-of-the-art systems are based on the Bag-of-Words model (BOW) for representing video frames and target object. When searching on nearly planar and rich-textured objects such as buildings and book cover, BOW argue to be a suitable model with very high performance. However, when searching on harder but more popular objects such as a specific person, BOW model still keep a lower performance. In this paper, we consider a new type of query which covers most popular topics: searching a person in a specific location. Inspired by recent successes of deep learning techniques, we propose new framework which leverage the powerful of both BOW model and deep feature in instance search. In particular, we use a linear kernel classifier instead of using L2 distance to compute similarity between two deep features. For further improvement, scene tracking are employed to deal with the cases face of query person is not detected. To evaluate the proposed methods, we conduct experiments over a standard benchmark dataset (TRECVID Instance Search 2016) with more than 300 GB in storage and 464 hours in duration. The results show that, our proposed methods significant improve the baseline system."
Violent scene detection using mid-level feature,"['Vu Lam', 'Sang Phan', 'Thanh Duc Ngo', 'Duy-Dinh Le', 'Duc Anh Duong', ""Shin'ichi Satoh""]",December 2013  ,SoICT '13: Proceedings of the Fourth Symposium on Information and Communication Technology,"Violent scene detection (VSD) refers to the task of detecting shots containing violent scenes in videos. With a wide range of promising real-world applications (e.g. movies/films inspection, video on demand, semantic video indexing and retrieval), VSD has been an important research problem. A typical approach for VSD is to learn a violent scene classifier and then apply it to video shots. Finding good feature representation for video shots is therefore essential to achieving high classification accuracy. It has been shown in recent work that using low-level features results in disappointing performance, since low-level features cannot convey high-level semantic information to represent violence concept. In this paper, we propose to use mid-level features to narrow the semantic gap between low-level features and violence concept. The mid-level features of a training (or test) video shots are formulated by concatenating scores returned by attribute classifiers. Attributes related to violence concept are manually defined. Compared to the original violence concept, the attributes have smaller gap to the low-level feature. Each corresponding attribute classifier is trained by using low-level features. We conduct experiments on MediaEval VSD benchmark dataset. The results show that, by using mid-level features, our proposed method outperforms the standard approach directly using low-level features."
An efficient method for face retrieval from large video datasets,"['Thao Ngoc Nguyen', 'Thanh Duc Ngo', 'Duy-Dinh Le', ""Shin'ichi Satoh"", 'Bac Hoai Le', 'Duc Anh Duong']",July 2010  ,CIVR '10: Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Image and Video Retrieval,"The human face is one of the most important objects in videos since it provides rich information for spotting certain people of interest, such as government leaders in news video, or the hero in a movie, and is the basis for interpreting facts. Therefore, detecting and recognizing faces appearing in video are essential tasks of many video indexing and retrieval applications. Due to large variations in pose changes, illumination conditions, occlusions, hairstyles, and facial expressions, robust face matching has been a challenging problem. In addition, when the number of faces in the dataset is huge, e.g. tens of millions of faces, a scalable method for matching is needed. To this end, we propose an efficient method for face retrieval in large video datasets. In order to make the face retrieval robust, the faces of the same person appearing in individual shots are grouped into a single face track by using a reliable tracking method. The retrieval is done by computing the similarity between face tracks in the databases and the input face track. For each face track, we select one representative face and the similarity between two face tracks is the similarity between their two representative faces. The representative face is the mean face of a subset selected from the original face track. In this way, we can achieve high accuracy in retrieval while maintaining low computational cost. For experiments, we extracted approximately 20 million faces from 370 hours of TRECVID video, of which scale has never been addressed by the former attempts. The results evaluated on a subset consisting of manually annotated 457,320 faces show that the proposed method is effective and scalable."
A Software Defined Networking Approach for Guaranteeing Delay in Wi-Fi Networks,"['Do Thi Thu Hien', 'Thanh Duc Ngo', 'Duy-Dinh Le', 'Hiroo Sekiya', 'Van-Hau Pham', 'Kien Nguyen']",December 2019  ,SoICT 2019: Proceedings of the Tenth International Symposium on Information and Communication Technology,"Recently, low latency has become one of the most critical requirements in Wi-Fi networks (e.g., for Internet access). Many factors and events such as bufferbloat, which unexpectedly happen, can affect the delay of Wi-Fi networks. Hence, the delay requirement leads to the essential of a management mechanism, which can 1) correctly detect negative behavior in latency; 2) and adjust network settings adaptively. In this paper, we introduce a solution for the two mentioned issues, which uses the emerging Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology. Our SDN-based method can guarantee a predetermined value of delay in the Wi-Fi network by taking advantage of SDN. More specifics, we correctly monitor the delay fluctuation in Wi-Fi networks on an SDN controller. We then deploy a task of queue adjustment when the delay value exceeds the predetermined one. We have developed and evaluated our method using the mininet-wifi emulator and POX controller. The results show that we can maintain the guaranteed delay level for packet transmissions without significant effects on network performance."
